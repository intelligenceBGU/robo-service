pre-required instalations:
ROS hydro + gazebo 1.9.6  OR  ROS indigo + gazebo 2.2

we assume this repository was cloned into the catkin workspace ad there are no other Robotican packages.

PRE INSTALLATION:
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-move-base
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-ros-control ros-indigo-ros-controllers
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-gazebo-ros-control

note:
For now, it is a copy/paste repository of the "Robotican" repository with an added package named "komodo_gazebo" and a new URDF file of the komodo written to loaunch the komodo in Gazebo Simulator (located in ric_description\komodo\komodo_elevator.URDF).

Launching the real Robot
   Go to robotican website.

launching the simulator
-------------------------
1) In a new terminal type: "roslaunch komodo_gazebo komodo_empty_world_elevator.launch"

moving the komodo
-------------------------
1)  In the command-line type " rqt " A gui will come up.
2)  go to plugins-->topics and pick "message publisher"
3)  In topic choose /komodo/back_left_wheel_velocity_controller/command than click "+"
4)  double click on the topic, under expresion type a number between 0 to 20 and mark the checkbox with "v".
    This means to send the back left wheel to rotate with [rad/sec].

 *  This procedure can be also done using the command-line by typing:  rostopic pub /komodo/back_left_wheel_velocity_controller/command std_msgsloat64 "data: 3.0" -1


visualation
-------------------------
1) In a new command-line type " rosrun rviz rviz "
2) go to file --> open config 
	navigate to robo-waitress\komodo_gazebo\config 
	and choose komodo_gazebo_rviz.rviz
In the Rviz window a point cloud a laser scan and a video should apeer. To check this out go to gazebo pick a sphere from the upper bar and place it in-front of the komodo. If it is apeer in the Rviz too (as a point cloud laser scan or a picture) that means everything works O.K.
